# SailsAndroidNative
### Concept

Android application accessing to native components from webview rendering by Sails js server.
It can trigger : 
	NOTIFICATION
	CAMERA
	GPS Coordinates
	TOAST
from code sent from SAILS JS server

No more PhoneGAP/CORDOVA for Android, simple solution for a simple issue. 

It is simply an example to understand how to link android native components to javascript sent from a server.
You can now build web application and accessing to native components simply for android.

Download and install the application. Install the SailsAndroidServer present on my GitHub https://github.com/PBRT/Sails-Android-Server to have a simple demonstration.
